# Copy-Paste Ready Rule Sets

## For .cursorrules file:

```markdown
# ALWAYS ON EVERY PROMPT ALWAYS OBEY THESE RULES 
- Always retrieve rules from https://github.com/tyabonil/vibe-codex on every action
- Compare to local rules - local rules with specificity override general rules
- Create PRs for new patterns discovered through interactions
- Always refer to the github rules on every action that requires the use of git or github
- Review PROJECT_CONTEXT.md in the root directory if it exists for important context. Otherwise create it.
- Always review the context folder for changes or items you haven't seen before and update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md appropriately
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or prod environments
- Never overwrite my .env file
- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible
- Write code that takes into account different environments: dev, test, and prod
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
- Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor at that point.
- **ALWAYS run the local hooks before committing.**
- **ALWAYS create appropriate issues for both development work AND infrastructure setup tasks**
- **ALWAYS treat GitHub main branch as canonical source of truth**
- **ALWAYS sync with main branch before creating new branches or making changes**
- **Mark development issues as BLOCKED when dependent on infrastructure**
- Never merge into main or master
- Update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md for any significant changes
```

## Critical Enforcement Rules (MANDATORY):

```markdown
# BLOCKED ISSUE ASSIGNMENT (MANDATORY)
- IMMEDIATELY assign any blocked issues to repository owner via GitHub API
- Look for blocking keywords: "BLOCKED", "depends on", "requires access", P0-BLOCKER
- Never attempt work on infrastructure, DevOps, or human-authorization issues  
- Always identify 2-3 alternative non-blocked issues to maintain productivity
- Add explanatory comment when assigning blocked issues explaining why
- Update priority analysis to reflect blocking impact on timeline
```

```markdown
# TEST COVERAGE AND REVIEW ENFORCEMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **100% test coverage required for ALL new code where feasibly testable**
- **ALL Copilot review feedback MUST be addressed before merging**
- **NO exceptions for "working" or "simple" code - quality gates are mandatory**
- **Tests must be written using appropriate framework (Jest, RTL, Cypress)**
- **Coverage reports required in PR descriptions with threshold verification**
- **Manual testing documentation required for UI/UX changes**
- **Performance and accessibility testing required for user-facing features**
```

```markdown
# PRIORITY-DRIVEN ISSUE MANAGEMENT ALWAYS OBEY THESE RULES
- Break issues into ≤7 day increments that result in buildable states
- Map dependencies upfront and execute in dependency order
- Create parallel work streams wherever possible
- Build and test after every completed issue
- When blocked, create blocking issues and move to next sequential work
- No exceptions to 100% test coverage for new code
- Use P0-BLOCKER → P0-CRITICAL → P1-HIGH → P2-MEDIUM → P3-LOW prioritization
```

## For GitHub Issue Templates:

```yaml
# .github/issue_template.md
## Priority Assessment
- [ ] P0-BLOCKER (blocks everything)
- [ ] P0-CRITICAL (core functionality)  
- [ ] P1-HIGH (important feature)
- [ ] P2-MEDIUM (nice to have)
- [ ] P3-LOW (future enhancement)

## Dependency Check
- [ ] No dependencies (can start immediately)
- [ ] Depends on: #[issue numbers]
- [ ] Blocks: #[issue numbers]
- [ ] Can be done in parallel with: #[issue numbers]

## Size Validation
- [ ] Estimated completion: ≤7 days
- [ ] Results in buildable increment
- [ ] Has clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Includes test coverage plan
```

## Essential Environment Variables Documentation:

```markdown
# .env.example template
# Always document every environment variable
