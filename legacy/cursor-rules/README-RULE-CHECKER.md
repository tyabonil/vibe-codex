# MANDATORY Rules - Local Hooks

## 🎯 Overview

A set of pre-commit and commit-msg hooks that validate every commit against the MANDATORY-RULES.md, providing comprehensive feedback and blocking critical violations.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1.  **`pre-commit` Hook**:
    -   **`pr-health-check.sh`**: Checks for stale pull requests and compliance violations.
    -   **`security-pre-commit.sh`**: Scans for secrets in your staged files.
2.  **`commit-msg` Hook**:
    -   **`commit-msg-validator.sh`**: Validates that your commit message follows the Conventional Commits specification.
3.  **`config/rules.json`**:
    -   A configuration file that allows you to customize the behavior of the hooks.
