## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific
- ‚ùå "Working on it"
- ‚úÖ "Implemented user model with email validation, working on password hashing"

### 2. Include Context
- ‚ùå "Found a bug"
- ‚úÖ "Found race condition in session handling when multiple tabs are open"

### 3. Document Decisions
- ‚ùå "Changed the approach"
- ‚úÖ "Switched from localStorage to secure cookies for token storage due to XSS concerns"

### 4. Link Resources
- Include links to:
  - Related PRs
  - Documentation
  - External discussions
  - Design decisions

### 5. Use Checklists
Track progress visually:
```markdown
**Implementation Progress:**
- [x] User model
- [x] Authentication logic
- [x] Login UI
- [ ] Password reset
- [ ] Remember me
```

## Templates

### Daily Progress Update

1. Option A - Pros/Cons
2. Option B - Pros/Cons

**Impact:** [What this means for the project]
```

4. **Debugging** - Historical context helps solve issues
5. **Compliance** - Audit trail for changes

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Update Bombs
‚ùå No updates for days, then a wall of text

‚úÖ Regular, concise updates as you work

### 2. Vague Updates
‚ùå "Made some changes"

‚úÖ "Refactored auth middleware to use async/await pattern"

### 3. Missing Context
‚ùå "Fixed the bug"

‚úÖ "Fixed race condition in session cleanup that caused logouts"

### 4. No Follow-Through
‚ùå Mention blocker, never update when resolved

‚úÖ "Blocked by X" ‚Üí "X resolved, continuing with implementation"

## Integration with Tools

### Git Hooks
```bash
# Post-commit reminder
"üìù Don't forget to update issue #123 with your progress!"
```

### PR Template
```markdown
## Issue Update Checklist
- [ ] Updated issue with PR link
- [ ] Documented any changes from plan
- [ ] Listed what was delivered
```

### GitHub Actions
- Automatic PR creation notifications
- Review feedback reminders
- Merge/close notifications

## Summary

Keeping issues updated is not bureaucracy‚Äîit's communication. Your future self and your team will thank you for maintaining clear, comprehensive issue histories.
