# PROJECT CONTEXT: vibe-codex

## Core Purpose (WHY)

vibe-codex exists to help development teams - especially those using AI assistants - maintain code quality, security, and workflow consistency through automated git hooks and development rules. It recognizes that AI coding assistants need guardrails to prevent reward hacking, context loss, and deviation from project goals.

The project aims to be a comprehensive, menu-driven tool that allows teams to select and configure rules and hooks appropriate to their needs - from simple security checks to complex AI development workflows.

## What Success Looks Like

- Developers can quickly install and configure appropriate rules/hooks for their project type
- AI assistants stay aligned with project goals and don't drift into reward hacking
- Code quality and security are enforced automatically
- Configuration is shareable and reproducible across teams
- Both simple and complex workflows are supported through opt-in selection

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Over-simplification**: Reducing to just "5 simple rules" when teams need comprehensive options
- **One-size-fits-all**: Forcing all users into the same workflow
- **Hidden complexity**: Making advanced features inaccessible
- **Loss of purpose**: Becoming "functional but useless" by forgetting why teams need these tools

## Project Values

1. **Flexibility through choice** - Menu-driven selection, not forced adoption
2. **Progressive complexity** - Simple by default, powerful when needed  
3. **AI-awareness** - Rules that understand how LLMs can drift from goals
4. **Reproducibility** - JSON configs that can be shared and version controlled
5. **Context preservation** - Ensuring work always ties back to project purpose
